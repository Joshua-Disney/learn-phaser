CLASSES
Introduction to Classes
JavaScript is an object-oriented programming (OOP) language we can use to model real-world items. In this lesson, you will learn how to make classes. Classes are a tool that developers use to quickly produce similar objects.

Take, for example, an object representing a dog named halley. This dogâ€™s name (a key) is "Halley" (a value) and has a behavior (another key) of 0 (another value). We create the halley object below:

class Surgeon {
  constructor(name, department) {
    this._name = name;
    this._department = department;
    this._remainingVacationDays = 20;
  }
  
  get name() {
    return this._name;
  }
  
  get department() {
    return this._department;
  }
  
  get remainingVacationDays() {
    return this._remainingVacationDays;
  }
  
  takeVacationDays(daysOff) {
    this._remainingVacationDays -= daysOff;
  }
}

const surgeonRomero = new Surgeon('Francisco Romero', 'Cardiovascular');
const surgeonJackson = new Surgeon('Ruth Jackson', 'Orthopedics');

console.log(surgeonRomero.name)
surgeonRomero.takeVacationDays(3)
console.log(surgeonRomero.remainingVacationDays)
