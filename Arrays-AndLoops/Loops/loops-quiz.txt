INITIAL SCORE: 9/9  100%



1: You want to run a code block at least once, then loop as long as a condition remains true. Which kind of loop would you use?

A: A do...while statement
B: A for statement
C: A nested for loop
D: A while statement

My guess: A
CORRECT


2: Which statement is true about while loops?

A: while loops evaluate a condition for however long it’s true and the looping stops when the condition is false.
B: while loops only run while the condition is false.
C: while loops always loop over a code block a known amount of times.
D: while loops will run at least once, then will run again if their condition is true.

My guess: A
CORRECT


3: What is incorrect about the code block?

  for (let i = 0, i < myArray.length,  i++) {
    console.log(myArray[i]);
  };

A: The condition of the loop should be separated by semicolons, not commas.
B: i++ should be i = i + 1.
C: The for loop expressions are out of order.
D: let is not needed for the start condition.

My guess: A
CORRECT


4: What do nested for loops do?

A: Nested for loops allow us to run multiple for loops at once.
B: Nested for loops allow us to double check our if...else statements.
C: Nested for loops run the same code twice.
D: Nested for loops are bad because they run forever.

My guess: A
CORRECT


5: What will be the result of the code block?

let socialMedia = ['Instagram', 'Facebook', 'Twitter'];
 
for (let socialMediaIndex = 0; socialMediaIndex < socialMedia.length; socialMediaIndex++) {
    console.log(socialMedia[socialMediaIndex]);
}

A: ‘Twitter’
‘Facebook’
‘Instagram’

B: socialMedia[0]
socialMedia[1]
socialMedia[2]

C: ‘Instagram’
‘Facebook’
‘Twitter’

D: ‘0: Instagram’
‘1: Facebook’
‘2: Twitter’

My guess: C
CORRECT


6: What would the output of this block of code be?

const animal = 'cat';
 
for (let i = 0; i < animal.length; i++) {
  console.log(animal[i]);
  for (let j = 1; j < 4; j++) {
    console.log(j);
  }
}

A: c 1 2 3 a 1 2 3 t 1 2 3
B: c a t 1 2 3
C: 1 c a t 2 c a t 3 c a t
D: 1 c 2 a 3 t

My guess: A
CORRECT


7: Which statement is true about for loops?

A: for loops are appropriate when looping a predetermined number of times.
B: for loops can never result in an infinite loop.
C: for loops always run an unknown number of times.
D: for loops always count from 0 upwards.

My guess: A
CORRECT


8: What is the general purpose of a loop?

A: Loops read and recreate code automatically.
B: Loops automatically iterate a block of code based on conditions.
C: Loops iterate through arrays to find elements.
D: All loops help the computer make decisions automatically.

My guess: B
CORRECT


9: What problem is caused by this code block?

for (let i = 10; i > 0; i++) {
  console.log(i);
};

A: The code will loop forever because i will always be greater than 0.
B: The code won’t run because the stop condition is less than the start condition.
C: i = 10 and i > 0 should be switched.
D: You can’t run a loop without an array.

My guess: A
CORRECT
