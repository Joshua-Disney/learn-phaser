1: What will be the output of this code?

let sayHello = 'Hi there';
const sayGoodbye = 'Goodbye'; 
const speakItalian = () => {
  sayHello = 'Ciao!';
  console.log(sayHello);
  console.log(sayGoodbye);
};
speakItalian();

A Ciao!
ReferenceError: variable not defined.
B Hi there
Goodbye
C Ciao!
Goodbye

My Guess: C  Correct



2: What will be the output of this code?

const roadTrip = () => {
  const destination = 'Crater Lake, Oregon';
  const snacks = 'trail mix';
  const supplies = 'sleeping bags';
};
console.log(`Next stop: ${destination}`);

A Next stop: destination
B Next stop: Crater Lake, Oregon
C Uncaught ReferenceError: destination is not defined

My Guess: C  Correct



3: How many global variables are there in the following block of code?

const input = 8;
const controlVal = input / 2 + 3; 
const multiplier = (number, phase) => {
  const val = number * controlVal + phase;
  console.log(val);
};

A There are four: input, controlVal, val, and multiplier.
B There are three: input, controlVal, and val.
C There are two: input and controlVal.
D There are three: input, controlVal, and multiplier.

My Guess: C  Incorrect  Functions are variables.  Functions are variables.  I didn't know this but functions are variables.



4: Which best defines a variable with block scope?

A A variable that is available throughout a program.
B A variable that is defined within a block and only available inside a block.
C A variable that is available within a function.
D A variable that is available outside of a block.

My Guess: B  Correct



5: What is preferable: defining variables in the global scope or defining variables in the block scope?

A Defining variables in the global scope. Variables defined in the block scope are restrictive and often conflict 
  with variables defined in the global scope.
B Defining variables in the block scope. Variables defined at the block level can still be used at the global level.
C Defining variables in the global scope and the block scope are equally preferable.
D Defining variables in the block scope. Variables defined in the global scope can cause unexpected behavior in our code.

My Guess: D  Correct



6: What is a globally scoped variable?

A A variable that is defined in a function.
B A variable that is accessible to any part of the program.
C A variable that is accessible in a block, and only inside a block.
D A variable that is also a parameter.

My Guess: B  Correct



7: Which variables possess block scope?

const input = 8;
const controlVal = input / 2 + 3;
const multiplier = (number, phase) => {
  const val = number * controlVal + phase;
  console.log(val);
};

A val, number, controlVal, phase
B number, phase, val
C input, controlVal
D input, controlVal, multiplier

My Guess: B  Correct



My Score: 6 / 7  86%
